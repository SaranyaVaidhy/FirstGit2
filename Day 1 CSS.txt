Structure of CSS :
————————

        h1{
            color: ;
            text-align: ;
            font-size: ; 
        }
  

*h1			——> For which Tag we are going to style /format that is called Selector 

*{ } 			——> Have to use the curly braces inside that only we have to pass style /format

*color
*text-align	——> If we are editing /adding anything that’s called property ,we can use unlimited properties 
*font-size





CSS can be added to HTML documents in Three Ways :
——————————————————————————
*Inline CSS
*Internal CSS
*External CSS


*Inline CSS : ( Inside the Tag worked as attribute — style )
—————
Using the Style attribute inside the HTML Tag


     <p style="color: red; text-align: justify;"> lorem100</p>




**Internal CSS : ( Inside the Head Tag )
——————
*Css rules by using a <style> element in the <head> section
*An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.
*If u want to differentiate the each same name of tag have to use  (id selector , class selector) concept 



***External CSS : (External *.CSS File)
————————
*Css rules by using external CSS file 
*An external stylesheet is a standalone . css file that is linked from a web page.
 The advantage of external stylesheets is that it can be created once and the rules applied to multiple web pages.
